- **Smart Similarity Matching**: Uses a hybrid algorithm that considers:
  - Genre overlap (40% weight)
  - Director match (25% weight)
  - Actor overlap (20% weight)
  - Year similarity (15% weight)
- **Beautiful UI**: Modern, responsive design with dark mode support
- **Detailed Explanations**: See why each movie was recommended with similarity score breakdowns
- **Real-time Search**: Autocomplete movie search with instant suggestions

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- TMDB API Key (free at [https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api](https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api))

### Installation

1. **Clone or navigate to the project directory**
   ```bash
   cd movie-finder
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up your API key**

   Open the `.env` file and replace `your_api_key_here` with your actual TMDB API Read Access Token:
   ```env
   VITE_TMDB_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key
   ```

4. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. **Open your browser**

   Navigate to `http://localhost:5173` (or the URL shown in your terminal)

## 📖 How to Use

1. **Search for Movies**: Type a movie title in the search bar to see suggestions
2. **Select 1-3 Movies**: Click on movies from the search results to add them (max 3)
3. **Get Recommendation**: Click the "Get Recommendation" button
4. **Explore Results**: View your personalized recommendation with similarity scores and explanations
5. **Try Again**: Click "Try Again" to get another recommendation with different movies

## 🧮 Recommendation Algorithm

### Phase 1: Similarity-Based (Current)

The recommendation engine uses a weighted scoring system:

1. **Genre Matching** (40%): Uses Jaccard similarity to compare genre overlap
2. **Director Matching** (25%): Binary match (1 or 0)
3. **Actor Matching** (20%): Jaccard similarity for cast overlap
4. **Year Similarity** (15%): Linear decay based on release year difference

**Formula:**
```
Total Score = (Genre × 0.4) + (Director × 0.25) + (Actors × 0.2) + (Year × 0.15)
```

### Future Enhancements (Planned)

- Plot analysis using TF-IDF
- Collaborative filtering with user ratings
- Machine learning models

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "No movies found" error
- Check that your API key is correctly set in `.env`
- Verify you're using the **API Read Access Token** (not the API Key v3)
